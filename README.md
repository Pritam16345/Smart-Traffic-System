# SIH Smart Traffic Management System

This is an AI-based traffic management system developed for the Smart India Hackathon. The system uses Reinforcement Learning (Q-learning) to train an agent that can dynamically control traffic signals to reduce congestion. The simulation is built using SUMO.

## Tech Stack
- **Simulation:** SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility)
- **AI/Backend:** Python, Flask
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Q-learning (Numpy)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## How to Run
1.  Ensure you have SUMO and Python 3.10+ installed.
2.  Set the `SUMO_HOME` environment variable.
3.  Create and activate a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv` and `source venv/bin/activate`.
4.  Install dependencies: `pip install Flask numpy`.
5.  To run the dashboard and simulation: `python dashboard.py`.
6.  Open your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
